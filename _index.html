				<p>I took part in the DARPA Machine Common Sense (MCS) reasearch at OSU. We collaborated with roboticists and developmental psychologists from the UoU and NYU. We competed against other research groups at Berkley, MIT/IBM, Stanford, etc.
                                   Two of the three methods I helped develop at OSU took 1st place. I was the sole developer for Theory of Mind tasks. There's more tasks in the playlist. E.g. intuiting gravity, testing theory of mind, navigating a room looking for a trophy, etc.

				AI Plays Guitar Hero 3 on a Surface Pro 4 & Edge TPU. Still a work in progress. The CNN model does not currently recognize star power but it has still 4 starred this song. Recorded using OBS. Both recording and playing are done on a Surface Pro 4 at 60 FPS. Inference is hardware accelerated using a Google Edge TPU and TFSlim. This ended up taking a little more than 2 weeks to implement.

				<p>I trained several TensorFlow models to play Tetris using OpenAI Baseline's A2C implementation. They trained at over 4,000 FPS using a 980ti graphics card. The first video of the playlist is of my best model. It can score a lot of perfect 4 line clears, but it generalizes poorly. The second video shows this model playing 18 games at once. The last video is of another model that does not score as many points per move, but generalizes very well. It frequently clears over 200 lines a game. Everything is controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The power supply was under-rated at the time of the filming. It can actually clear ~40 lines in 11 seconds. Much faster than the human record.

				<p>This Deep Neural Network TensorFlow model plays snake on an LED matrix. It could only ever be as good as the python script which generated its training data. People can play on the led too using a keyboard. The current high score is held by the AI though. I trained a better model using the evolutionary machine learning algorithm "NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies" (NEAT), but it is nowhere near as entertaining.

				<p>I made this blog in order to learn Django and to become more familiar with MVC frameworks. I am most proud of the responsive images. They retain their beauty at all screen sizes, and keep the page weight to a minimum. One difficulty I encountered was installing a WYSIWYG editor package. The editor made it so I could more easily include images in my blog posts. I wrote 2 great posts about Nuclear Fusion and the Magellanic Clouds. Go read them by clicking the thumbnail!</p>
